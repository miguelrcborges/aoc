In his year, I was reading SICP, which made me want to play with lambdas.

Considered learning a new language (especially a LISP one), but
- Most modern lisps don't do tail call optimization.
- Relatively short time available for such investment.

Being that the case, I decided doing in JavaScript, while using mostly
the concepts present in the book.


NOTE: It was solved using the console on the browser, which doesn't have file IO,
so I would just declare a const variable input with the content.

UPDATE

May start using fennel, since my day 10 solution would stack overflow
the browser's runtime. To run the solution, I had to use deno and increase
it's stack size.

```
const input = `<file contents>`
```
